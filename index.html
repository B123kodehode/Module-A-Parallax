    <h2>Freedom</h2>
<p>The Freedom that comes from driving on a Motorcycle, cannot be compared to simply driving around inside of a car. While driving on a Motorcycle and feeling the air around you, will give you a greater sensation of joy than a car ever would. It's nimbleness and the feeling you experience when attacking corners is something many motorcycle drivers enjoy. </p>
